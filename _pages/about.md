# ICS Watch Dog

[Microsoft Sysinternals Sysmon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) is one of the methods for improving your organization's understanding of what has happened on your Microsoft servers and workstations. It improves your visibility while also providing the means to protect you system through application monitoring and control. The [ICS Watch Dog](https://icswatchdog.com) project aims to provide a usable Sysmon implementation from the start of your monitoring program through its maturity. We are here to help your team and we are hoping your team will help this project via issues, comments, discussions, and usable templates.
